- Suitable for short sprints with many small tasks.
- Focused on quality through pull requests and reviews.
- Fully supported by GitHubâ€™s interface.

It allows us to move fast without sacrificing stability or collaboration.

#### Creating Issues from Templates

We use our issue templates to ensure consistency and clarity across all tasks.

Our templates:
- [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md)  
  Used to report bugs with clear reproduction steps and expected behavior.
- [Technical Task](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/technical-task.md)  
  For backend, refactoring, or implementation-related work broken down into subtasks.
- [User Story](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-story.md)  
  Describes user-facing functionality with acceptance criteria.

All team members are required to use one of these templates when creating new issues.
